# Steam-Fix
I got tired of steam getting broken and requiring a kill to get working again so i made a script for both windows and linux

for the password manager function, YAD and OpenSSL are required. Anywhere you see CHANGE_KEY you need to add your own random encryption key, I also recommend compiling the script with SHC to hide the key more.
