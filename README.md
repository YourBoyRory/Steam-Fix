# Steam-Fix
I got tired of steam getting broken and requiring a kill to get working again so i made a script for both windows and linux

for the password manager fuction yad and openssl are required.
Anywhere you see CHANGE_KEY you need to addd your own encryption key, i also recomend compiling the script with shc to hide the key more.
